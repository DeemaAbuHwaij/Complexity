# Complexity
This repository contains my solutions for the assignments in the Compiler Construction course taught by Mayer Goldberg. The course focuses on building a compiler using OCaml and includes three main tasks: two programming assignments and a final project. The final project involves writing assembly code in the Intel x86 instruction set and using the Linux ABI.
